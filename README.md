Engineer. Systems Thinker. Builder of better realities.

Iâ€™m not here to play with tools. Iâ€™m here to bend them into systems that solve real problems.
Right now, that means AI at the edge â€” thinking machines where latency matters and cloud isnâ€™t fast enough.
Also going deep into Regenerative Design, because the future should be both intelligent and sustainable.

If youâ€™re building something that needs to see, think, or respond â€” we might have a conversation.

âš¡ I build to simplify complexity. I automate what drags. I rethink whatâ€™s stale.
